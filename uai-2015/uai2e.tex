\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
We develop hierarchical Poisson matrix factorization (HPF), a novel
method for providing users with high quality recommendations based on
implicit feedback, such as views, clicks, or purchases.  In contrast
to existing recommendation models, HPF has a number of desirable
theoretical and practical properties.  First, we show that HPF more
accurately captures the skew in user activity found in most
consumption data by explicitly considering the fact that users have
finite attention budgets.  This leads to better estimates of users'
latent preferences, and therefore superior recommendations, compared
to existing approaches.  Second, HPF learns these latent factors by
only explicitly considering positive examples, eliminating the often
costly step of generating artificial negative examples when fitting to
implicit data.  Third, HPF is more than just one method---it is the
simplest in a class of probabilistic models with these properties, and
is easily extended to include more complex structure and assumptions.
We develop a variational algorithm for approximate posterior inference
for HPF that scales up to large data sets, and we demonstrate its
performance on a wide variety of real-world recommendation
problems---users rating movies, listening to songs, reading scientific
papers, and reading news articles.  Our study reveals that
hierarchical Poisson factorization definitively outperforms previous
methods, including nonnegative matrix factorization, topic models, and
probabilistic matrix factorization techniques.
